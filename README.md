# [myhrefs.com](https://myrefs.com)
> Your only social portfolio

This project comes from the need of a single platform to showcase content from multiple social sources in a unified way.
Many artists, content creators and anyone with enough social content really can benefit from a fully customizable profile where it's easy to highlight their best photos or videos.

After the disruption of internet advertising systems based on users data collection to craft micro-targeted ads we've seen how users have lost control of the sites that represents them. Something similar to the `good ol' MySpace` isn't thinkable today, as the companies would never risk appearing in a random profile filled with satanic music, high contrast colours and/or anime pictures in it.

I hope [myhrefs.com](https://myrefs.com) can work as _"your little own internet corner"_ where you get to choose what colors and font styles better match your persona. A breeze of fresh air in an era where we have so many digital profiles we don't know which one to share when asked for. Link all your profiles at the reach of a click and use the carousel gallery to show-off your best Instagram, YouTube, Spotify or TikTok creations.

# FAQ

> Is it free?
- Yes, this is yet another personal side-project with little to no cost for now.

> Can I donate to the project?
- No, you can't even "buy me a cofee" :-p I won't share any kind of account/address until I have to pay the first cent due to actual use.

> Can I get a custom URI like [myhrefs.com/profile/darkodixit](https://myhrefs.com/profile/darkodixit)?
- Sure thing! Leave a star in this repo and open an issue with your current profile-id. I will then assign you the profile-name of your choice (as long as it's not taken, obviously).

> Is this an open-source project? If so, where is the source repo?
- Yes, this repo is only hosting the final build of the project. The sources are also hosted on GitHub and it's open to collaborations but the main reason it's not public is security around backend and configs. If you want to collaborate, open an issue in this repo requesting it and I will happily make you a member of the sources repo. Just make sure you have some familiarity with Vue3 beforehand.
